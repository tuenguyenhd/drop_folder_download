# Download dropbox folder
- Download dropbox public shared folder. 
- The wedding photographer sent me a shared folder which is too large to be downloaded  a zip file and exceeds than my Dropbox capacity so I wrote this script.
- Usage: `python shared_drop.py public_shared_folder_url`
- Required package: `requests`, `lxml`
